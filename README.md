# Towers-Of-Hanoi
Program that will solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle with best possible solution path

Programmer: Alex Balayan \n
Class: CS471 - Artificial Intelligence - Final Project
Project Files: final.cpp

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project uses artificial intelligence principles to solvee the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.  The main program is located in the final.cpp file and takes into accont all possible moves that are allowed within the puzzle, as illustrated in the visual states diagram hanoistates.jpg.  Based on the combinations of reachable states that lead to a final state, the program will evaluate the shortest path possible by evaluating the frontier (how many moves have been made plus how many discs are yet to reach the final peg).  

This program was compiled and run using the CSUSM empress unix server via G++.
